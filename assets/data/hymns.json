How great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:\nHow great Thou art! How great Thou art!\n\nWhen through the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze."
